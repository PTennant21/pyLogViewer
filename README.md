pyLogViewer is a program that reads EPICS Process Variable log files with the ability to open, sort and search through results.

Open File allows for a log file to be chosen for display.

The "Max Lines" box specifies the amount of lines to be read. If higher than the log's length or zero, it will read the entire file.

The "Seconds to Refresh" box specifies the amount of seconds to wait before re-reading the specified amount of lines. If set to zero, it never does this.

Find Next and Previous search forwards and backwards through the table highlighting a specified value.

Case sensitive toggles whether the search ignores capitals.
